### From Curious Beginner to Aspiring Professional

#### Introduction:

Welcome to my first blog post! I’m excited to take you beyond the bullet points of my resume and share a closer look at my journey in cybersecurity—what drives me, the hands-on skills I’ve developed, and the experiences that have shaped me as a professional. My aim here is to give you real insight into the passion and dedication I bring to cybersecurity, not just as a job, but as a field I truly believe in. I invite you to join me in exploring my career story, lessons learned along the way, and my perspective on the evolving landscape of cybersecurity.

#### My Background:

My journey into cybersecurity began long before I even knew the field existed. Growing up in Tanzania, I spent countless afternoons after school helping my mom at her liquor business, where she was the exclusive distributor of Tanzania Breweries Limited (TBL) in our region. I’d be there in my school uniform, helping her count cash, track stock, and balance handwritten records—a stark contrast to the digital systems I’d later come to know. Even then, I was curious about technology; I’d often suggest to my mom that her business could benefit from going digital. But her immediate response was always a question I didn’t yet know how to answer: **“How secure are these platforms?”**

This curiosity about technology stayed with me. During my final year of high school, my school introduced a computer class, and even though we only had one hour a week in the lab, I was fascinated by the world opening up before me. Determined to learn more, I convinced my mom to enroll me in a local computer café, where I learned to use the MS Office suite. The moment I typed my first document or created my first spreadsheet, I felt the possibilities of technology spark my imagination.

In 2013, after I graduated high school, my dad began the visa process for my sister and me to study in the U.S., and we arrived in 2014. Faced with the decision of choosing a major, I felt the weight of family expectations: my mom hoped I’d pursue accounting to help with her business, while my aunt thought I should go into medicine. But all I could think about was my drive to explore technology, intensified by every interaction I’d had with it—from escalators at the airport to the computer we had at home for studying. I realized then that I wanted a career in technology, and more specifically, one that could help me answer my mom’s old question about digital security.

With cybersecurity emerging as an essential field, I knew it was the path I needed to follow. Though few colleges offered cybersecurity as a major back then, I began my studies in Information Technology at a community college, where my dad could manage tuition costs, and eventually transferred to a four-year university to complete my bachelor’s. My journey came full circle when I earned my master’s in cybersecurity, finally gaining the skills to answer those early questions about the safety of digital platforms and deepen my commitment to the field.

#### Professional Experience:

My professional journey in technology began with a role as an **Advanced Repair Agent** at Best Buy’s Geek Squad. Growing up, my dad had always emphasized the importance of education, so I didn’t enter the workforce until I completed my bachelor's degree. With limited U.S. work experience, I started in retail, where I found a unique opportunity at **Geek Squad**, immersing myself in hands-on repair work. Here, I was responsible for troubleshooting and repairing both macOS and Windows computers, often customizing systems for gaming enthusiasts or diagnosing complex issues like virus infections.

When I first joined, I began as a customer service agent, greeting clients, listening to their issues, and documenting details in the ticketing system for the advanced repair team. **Within just three months, however, my manager recognized my strong technical skills and promoted me to the Advanced Repair Agent role.** This position allowed me to dive deeper into diagnostics, virus removal, system builds, and client education on cybersecurity best practices, all while utilizing my knowledge from my studies in information security.

After gaining valuable experience at Best Buy for nearly two years, I set my sights on entering the corporate tech environment, which led me to a role as a **Service Desk Specialist at Grubhub**. This transition marked my first foray into corporate IT support, where I provided technical troubleshooting, problem-solving, and client support in a fast-paced, dynamic environment. My experience at Grubhub deepened my understanding of corporate systems and refined my communication skills, as I learned to address and resolve issues efficiently for a diverse range of clients.

These roles laid the groundwork for my move into cybersecurity, where I’ve since held positions as an **Incident Response Specialist at leading financial institutions, including First Republic and JPMorgan Chase**. In these roles, I leveraged the technical foundation and client-focused mindset I developed early on to respond to security incidents, analyze threats, and mitigate risks. My journey from hands-on computer repairs to corporate service desk support and eventually into cybersecurity has equipped me with a well-rounded skill set, a problem-solving mindset, and a commitment to protecting data and systems.
