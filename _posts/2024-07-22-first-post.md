## From Curious Beginner to Cybersecurity Specialist.

### Introduction:

Welcome to my first blog post! I’m excited to take you beyond the bullet points of my resume and share a closer look at my journey in cybersecurity—what drives me, the hands-on skills I’ve developed, and the experiences that have shaped me as a professional. My aim here is to give you real insight into the passion and dedication I bring to cybersecurity, not just as a job, but as a field I truly believe in. I invite you to join me in exploring my career story, lessons learned along the way, and my perspective on the evolving landscape of cybersecurity.


### My Background:

Growing up in Tanzania, my first exposure to the tech world came from helping my mom with her liquor business, tracking inventory and balancing handwritten records. Fascinated by how technology could improve her business, I was driven by a curiosity that grew stronger when I first took computer classes in high school. This initial fascination set me on a path toward studying technology more formally.

After moving to the U.S. in 2014, I faced the decision of choosing a major. While family encouraged careers in medicine or accounting, my interest lay in exploring technology and understanding security. I began my studies in IT at a community college, later transferring to a four-year program where I completed my bachelor’s. I eventually earned a master’s in cybersecurity, gaining skills to answer my early questions about digital safety.


### Professional Experience:

My career in tech began as an Advanced Repair Agent at Geek Squad, where I handled computer repairs and virus removal for macOS and Windows systems. Starting in customer service, I was quickly promoted to handle advanced diagnostics, which deepened my technical skills and client communication abilities.

With a solid technical foundation, I transitioned to a corporate IT role at Grubhub, where I provided technical support in a fast-paced setting. This experience prepared me for my current focus on cybersecurity. As an Incident Response Specialist at financial institutions like First Republic and JPMorgan Chase, I tackled security incidents and analyzed threats, drawing on both my technical skills and customer-focused mindset.


### Skills and Expertise:

Over the years, I’ve developed a diverse skill set:

- **Technical Troubleshooting & Repair**: My time at Geek Squad provided a strong foundation in diagnosing and repairing systems, virus removal, and educating clients on cybersecurity basics.
- **Incident Response & Threat Analysis**: In financial cybersecurity roles, I used tools like Splunk and CrowdStrike to monitor threats and respond to incidents, collaborating with cross-functional teams for remediation.
- **Digital Forensics & Investigations**: I’ve investigated compromised accounts, analyzed digital evidence, and ensured account security through in-depth analysis.
- **SIEM & Security Tools**: My hands-on experience with SIEM tools allows me to monitor networks, analyze logs, and hunt for threats effectively.
- **Client Communication**: Translating technical findings into actionable insights for non-technical stakeholders has been key to my approach, ensuring clear, empathetic communication in security situations.
- **Scripting & Automation**: I leverage scripting to streamline processes like log analysis and incident reporting, saving time and enhancing efficiency.
- **Cloud Security Knowledge**: Exposure to cloud platforms has given me foundational skills in securing cloud environments, a crucial area as organizations increasingly adopt cloud solutions.

Each of these skill areas represents a key part of my professional toolkit. Together, they empower me to tackle a wide range of cybersecurity challenges, from technical diagnostics to high-stakes incident response, all with a strong emphasis on protecting organizational assets and enhancing security resilience.


### Notable Projects:

Throughout my career, I’ve had the opportunity to lead and contribute to impactful projects that have honed my skills and advanced my technical expertise. Here are three key projects that highlight my professional experience in cybersecurity:

- **Malicious Email Incident Response at First Republic**: I led the response to a high-priority email breach, collaborating with IT and network security teams to isolate the incident, conduct scans, and implement DLP monitoring.
- **DFIR Toolkit Development**: During my master’s program, I created a digital forensics toolkit in Python, tailored for log collection and malware detection.
- **Fraud Analysis at First Republic**: Using Splunk, I analyzed suspicious account activity, detecting potential fraud and engaging with clients to confirm account security.

For a comprehensive view of my academic projects, please refer to the [**Projects page**](https://vkibaja.github.io/projects/), where I’ve detailed several additional initiatives I completed during my studies, each contributing to my technical foundation in cybersecurity.


### Personal Philosophy:

For me, cybersecurity is more than just a job—it’s a responsibility to protect and empower others in a digital world. I believe that a successful cybersecurity analyst must not only stay current with evolving threats but also translate complex security issues into clear, actionable insights that help people feel secure and informed.

As I move into a cybersecurity analyst role, I bring a dedication to continuous learning and a people-centered approach, ensuring that security measures are both robust and user-friendly. I see each incident as an opportunity to strengthen systems, educate users, and contribute to a safer digital environment. I’m driven by the proactive mindset needed to excel in cybersecurity, committed to staying adaptable and vigilant to make a meaningful impact.


### Looking Ahead: 

I’m excited about the future of cybersecurity and look forward to new challenges and growth opportunities. Whether through this blog, projects, or collaborations, I’m eager to continue learning and contributing to the field.

Thank you for joining me on this journey. I hope to share more experiences, insights, and cybersecurity trends here. Let’s explore and secure the digital world together!
