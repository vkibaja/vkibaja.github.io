## DFIR Project content

This is my capstone project at Northeastern University, created a toolkit for **Digital Forensics and Incident Response**.

* Designed a toolkit to improve the efficiency of forensic analysis by integrating reliable libraries and developed comprehensive documentation and Incident Response (IR) Playbooks for consistent and accurate evidence collection. 
* Integrated features such as system information retrieval, network and memory analysis, user activity monitoring, process analysis, and PCAP file examination using Python libraries like scapy, psutil, and getmac.
* Enhanced the speed and accuracy of forensic investigations, standardized evidence collection processes, and improved the ability to analyze diverse digital artifacts, addressing the complexities of modern digital devices and networks.
