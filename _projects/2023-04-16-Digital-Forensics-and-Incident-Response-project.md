### Digital Forensics & Incident Response (DFIR) Toolkit

In the rapidly evolving field of digital forensics and incident response, traditional methods of manually analyzing digital data are increasingly insufficient. Our project addresses these challenges by developing a comprehensive DFIR toolkit designed to streamline the analysis and processing of digital evidence. This toolkit integrates various tools and techniques, allowing forensic analysts to efficiently gather and examine digital artifacts related to cybercrime or security incidents.

#### Key Features and Solutions

- **Library Selection**: We meticulously selected user-friendly, reliable, and efficient libraries to ensure accurate analysis of digital evidence.
- **Continuous Improvement**: We rigorously tested our tools to ensure their functionality and reliability, minimizing the risk of errors in the analysis process.
- **Comprehensive Documentation**: Clear and concise documentation was provided for each tool, outlining its functionality, usage, and limitations, ensuring consistent and reliable evidence collection and analysis.
- **Incident Response (IR) Playbooks**: We developed detailed IR playbooks, offering step-by-step guidelines and protocols for responding to cybersecurity incidents.

#### Toolkit Components

1. **Network Analysis**: Tools for examining network traffic to identify suspicious activities and potential security breaches.
2. **Memory Analysis**: Techniques to analyze system memory for volatile data that could provide critical evidence.
3. **File/Folder Analysis**: Methods to scrutinize files and directories for hidden or malicious content.
4. **Account Activities**: Tools to track user activities, logins, and account changes to detect unauthorized access.
5. **IR Playbooks**: Standardized procedures to ensure a systematic approach to incident response.

#### MacOS System Information Tool

In addition to our DFIR toolkit, we developed a MacOS System Information Tool that provides detailed insights into various system aspects, enhancing the capabilities of forensic analysts working on MacOS devices. This tool includes:

- **Operating System Info**: Details about the OS version, build number, and more.
- **Network Info**: Information on network interfaces and configurations.
- **User Activities**: Data on current and last logged-in users.
- **Memory and Storage Analysis**: Statistics on used and free memory, and details on external storage devices.
- **Process Analysis**: Information about running processes, including memory usage and status.
- **File and Folder Analysis**: Insights into specific files and directories, including size and modification time.

Our project not only accelerates the forensic analysis process but also ensures accuracy and standardization, making it a valuable asset for digital forensic investigations. For more details on the tools, techniques, and results of our project, I invite you to read review the project in GitHub.
