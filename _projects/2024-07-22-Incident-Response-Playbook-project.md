## Incident Response (IR) Playbook content

This is a project where I acted as an Incident Response Manager and created **Incident Response Playbook** on 3 different incidents:

1. Unauthorized attempt to access payroll records
2. SQL injection vulnerability and
3. Blacklisted IP seen in the VPN connections
   
Provided written guidance for detecting, responding, and recovering from each of the three incidents.
