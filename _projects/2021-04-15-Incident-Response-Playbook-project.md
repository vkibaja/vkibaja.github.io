### Incident Response Playbook Summary

As part of my role as the Incident Response Manager at "Viva la Vita Online," an online store specializing in vitamins and food supplements, I developed a comprehensive Incident Response Playbook to address various cybersecurity incident scenarios. This project was crucial for ensuring that our organization can systematically and effectively respond to potential security threats.

The "Viva la Vita Online Incident Response Playbook" is a comprehensive guide outlining the procedures for managing cyber incidents within the organization. This playbook identifies key roles within the Cyber Incident Response Team (CIRT) and specifies their responsibilities. It offers detailed response strategies for various scenarios, ensuring a structured approach to incident detection, analysis, containment, eradication, and recovery.

#### Key Components:
- **Incident Response Team (CIRT) Composition**: Defines roles including the Incident Response Manager, Security Analyst, CISO, CIO/CTO, and other essential personnel, ensuring 24/7 availability and proper training for effective incident management.
- **General Incident Response Plan**: A step-by-step guide to prepare for, detect, analyze, contain, eradicate, and recover from incidents, with a focus on minimizing damage and restoring normal operations.
- **Detailed Scenarios**:
  - **Unauthorized Access to Payroll Records**: Addresses detection through SIEM logs, investigation of social engineering attacks, and immediate containment by resetting compromised passwords.
  - **SQL Injection Vulnerability**: Emphasizes proactive detection during audits, secure coding practices, and containment by disabling vulnerable code.
  - **Blacklisted IP Connection via VPN**: Involves immediate blocking of compromised accounts and IPs, thorough investigation, and strengthening authentication measures.

This playbook not only outlines the immediate response to specific incidents but also includes post-incident handling to improve future readiness and resilience. For a deeper dive into the processes and strategies employed, the [full document](https://vkibaja.github.io/assets/Incidence_Response_Playbook_VK.pdf) offers extensive insights into each response phase and scenario.
