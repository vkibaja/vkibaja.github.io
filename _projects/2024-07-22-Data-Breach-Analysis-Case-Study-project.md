### A Brief Summary of the Marriott Data Breach Analysis Case Study

In my comprehensive analysis of the 2018 data breach at Marriott International Inc., I delve into the intricacies of one of the most significant data breaches in American history. The breach, attributed to Chinese state hackers, exposed the personal data of up to 500 million guests. This included sensitive information such as passport numbers, addresses, credit cards, and more.

The breach was discovered on September 7, 2018, by an IBM Guardium database alert tool, revealing that the attackers had been infiltrating the system since 2014. The hackers employed various sophisticated tactics outlined in the MITRE ATT&CK Framework, including exploiting software vulnerabilities and using malware such as Remote Access Trojans (RATs).

Marriott's response involved substantial containment measures and infrastructure changes, including disabling compromised accounts, resetting passwords, and implementing multi-factor authentication. However, the company's delay in notifying users and the public drew criticism and led to significant legal repercussions.

This case study not only assesses the immediate impact of the breach but also examines the broader implications for data privacy legislation and industry practices. My analysis provides critical insights into the methods and motivations of state-sponsored cyber attacks and highlights essential lessons for improving cybersecurity protocols.

This case study not only provides a detailed analysis of the Marriott data breach but also integrates technical and contextual cybersecurity concepts learned throughout the course. The goal was to develop a comprehensive understanding of data breaches and enhance my ability to propose effective countermeasures.
