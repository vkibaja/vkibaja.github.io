### Project Summary: Security Risk Management and Assessment

In my comprehensive Security Risk Management and Assessment project, I conducted an in-depth evaluation of the security posture for a Hypothetical Government Agency (HGA). This project, under the guidance of Professor Themis A. Papageorge at Northeastern University, encompasses both theoretical and practical approaches to identifying, analyzing, and mitigating security risks.

**Key Components:**

1. **Asset Identification and Valuation:**
   - Catalogued critical assets such as financial resources, system components, and sensitive personal information.
   - Assigned monetary values to these assets to quantify their importance and potential impact of loss.

2. **Threat and Vulnerability Analysis:**
   - Identified and listed potential threats including information disclosure, network threats, and payroll frauds.
   - Mapped these threats to specific vulnerabilities such as unencrypted data transmission and unauthorized access.
   - Calculated likelihood probabilities for each threat-vulnerability pair.

3. **Current and Proposed Security Controls:**
   - Assessed existing security controls at HGA, identifying gaps and areas for improvement.
   - Proposed new controls including digital signatures, VPN implementation, and DMZ deployment to enhance security.

4. **Risk Calculations and Mitigation Strategies:**
   - Employed detailed methodologies to calculate initial and residual risks, both for assets and vulnerabilities.
   - Developed and implemented a series of risk prevention and response strategies to mitigate identified risks.
   - Applied additional hardening controls and conducted cost-benefit analyses to ensure the effectiveness of these strategies.

5. **Implementation Plan:**
   - Outlined a comprehensive plan for implementing the proposed security measures.
   - Included specific controls and policies for access control, network infrastructure, database security, and application development.

The project demonstrates my ability to perform thorough security risk assessments and develop robust mitigation strategies, ensuring the resilience and security of organizational assets.
