### Project Summary: Security Risk Management and Assessment

#### Overview
In my Security Risk Management and Assessment class, I took on the role of a **Security Risk Manager** and developed a comprehensive **Security Risk Management Plan** and Implementation Guide for both the Hypothetical Global Agency (HGA) and my chosen company, GrubHub. This project was structured to apply theoretical concepts learned in class to practical scenarios, providing a holistic approach to managing and mitigating security risks within an organization.

#### Project Structure
The project was divided into several parts, each focusing on different aspects of security risk management:

**Security Risk Management Assessment**
This section was based on assignments and presentations completed throughout the course. It included the following components:
1. **Executive Summary:** Summarized key points from the NIST template, making necessary assumptions where data was unavailable.
2. **Asset Inventory:** Listed all assets with their values.
3. **Threats and Vulnerabilities:** Identified potential threats and vulnerabilities, along with threat/vulnerability pairs and their probabilities.
4. **Impact Analysis:** Assessed the impact of these threats on assets.
5. **Control Mapping:** Mapped current and proposed security controls to the MOT (Management, Operational, and Technical) control families.
6. **Risk Calculations:** Calculated security risks, including residual risks after implementing proposed controls.
7. **Strategy Formulation:** Developed both prevention and response strategies, calculating budgets and comparing them to industry standards.
8. **Conclusion:** Conducted a cost-benefit analysis to determine the effectiveness of the proposed strategies.

**Security Risk Management Implementation Plan**
This section focused on practical implementation and included:
1. **Access Control:** Addressed policies for identification, authentication, authorization, and physical/logical access control.
2. **Network Infrastructure Security:** Covered enclave protection, firewalls, routers, and overall network security management.
3. **Database Security:** Included user authentication, data integrity, auditing, and backup/recovery measures.
4. **Application Development Security:** Discussed program management, data handling, cryptography, and secure development practices.
5. **Wireless Security:** Examined security measures for various wireless networks and devices.
6. **Cybersecurity Workforce:** Assessed the existing cybersecurity roles and tasks, recommending necessary enhancements.
7. **Risk Ranking:** Ranked asset and vulnerability risks across different security areas.

**Security Risk Management Recommendations**
This section provided a comprehensive list of recommended controls, methods, and policies based on the risk management analysis. It included:
1. **Implementation Costs and Benefits:** Detailed the costs and benefits of proposed security measures.
2. **Comparative Analysis:** Compared the security budgets and risk improvement metrics between HGA and my company, adjusted for industry-specific factors.

**Appendices**
Included detailed risk calculations, network topology diagrams, and additional data or analyses not covered in the main sections.

#### Key Deliverables
The final deliverables included a well-structured MS-Word document with all the required sections, tables, and figures. It also featured an executive presentation summarizing the key findings and recommendations, comparing the security risk management strategies of HGA and my company.

#### Learning Outcomes
This project allowed me to apply theoretical knowledge to real-world scenarios, enhancing my understanding of:
- Identifying and assessing security risks.
- Developing and implementing effective security controls.
- Performing cost-benefit analyses to determine the best risk management strategies.
- Preparing comprehensive security documentation and presentations.

Overall, this project was a valuable learning experience, equipping me with practical skills in **security risk management and assessment**.
