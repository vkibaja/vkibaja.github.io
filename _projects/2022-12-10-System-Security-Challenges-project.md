## System Security Challenges

These are **security system challenges** I worked on while at Northeastern University.

* Engaged in weekly practical challenges to develop skills in security assessment, threat modeling, and information protection strategies.
* Created and executed exploits on simulated applications, targeting vulnerabilities like XSS and buffer overflows.
* Gained foundational knowledge in Linux command line, web application security, binary exploitation, reverse engineering, malware analysis, and ethical hacking.
