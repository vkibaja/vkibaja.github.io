### Daily Learning Series: Cybersecurity and AI Fundamentals

In today’s fast-evolving tech landscape, staying current and continuously expanding one’s knowledge is not just a value but a necessity. To demonstrate my commitment to personal and professional growth, I am launching a Daily Learning Series as part of my portfolio. This initiative is designed to showcase my ability to learn, adapt, and consistently challenge myself in key areas of technology—Cybersecurity and Artificial Intelligence.

#### Project Objectives

- **Continuous Learning**: Develop a strong foundational understanding of cybersecurity (starting with Network+) and AI (starting with AI fundamentals).
- **Documentation and Sharing**: Create a daily record of my learning journey, including written summaries and concise video explanations, to make my progress accessible and transparent.
- **Skill Demonstration**: Showcase critical thinking, problem-solving, and the ability to learn complex technical topics in a structured, consistent manner.
- **Inspiration for Growth**: Motivate others in the tech community to embrace continuous learning and self-improvement.

#### Deliverables

1. **Daily PDF Documents**: Written documentation of what I’ve learned each day, complete with examples, practical applications, and personal insights.
2. **Short YouTube Videos**: Brief summaries of each day's topic, demonstrating my ability to communicate technical concepts clearly.
3. **Portfolio Updates**: A dedicated section on my portfolio where each topic will have:
a. A brief description of the learning focus for the day.
b. Links to the corresponding document and video.

#### Key Themes

- **Cybersecurity Fundamentals**: Kicking off with Network+ topics to solidify my understanding of networks, protocols, and essential security concepts.
- **AI Fundamentals**: Exploring the basics of Artificial Intelligence, focusing on practical applications, key concepts, and tools.
- **Growth and Consistency**: Showcasing daily commitment and the discipline to grow incrementally while documenting every step.

This project is not only a reflection of my technical journey but also a statement of my commitment to professional excellence. I aim to build foundational knowledge from scratch and document my journey as I go. I want to dedicate the whole of 2025, and hopefully many more years to come, to an ongoing learning curve for myself. I hope to inspire others to do the same and to showcase that tiny progress goes a long way.
